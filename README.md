# mcoptions
MCO is a python script that changes between options files in a single click.

# Why would I use this?
Changing between Minecraft versions automatically resets most options, this script aims to automate changing your settings back. If you frequently change between versions (1.16-1.8-1.7 for example) this script will save you a lot of time, it also helps if you prefer different settings for different modes (e.g between creative and survival)

# How do I use this?
Simply run the executable, there you can save your current options (You have to set these in Minecraft itself) and then save them. After that, you can load between these saved loadouts with a single click. It saves your current resource pack too.

# Where is this info stored?
in .minecraft/mco_loadouts

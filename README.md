# mcoptions
MCO is a python script that changes between options files in a single click.

# Why would I use this?
Changing between Minecraft versions automatically resets most options, this script aims to automate changing your settings back. If you frequently change between versions (1.16-1.8-1.7 for example) this script will save you a lot of time, it also helps if you prefer different settings for different modes (e.g between creative and survival)

# How do I use this?
Simply run the executable, there you can save your currently set options (In Minecraft, so you have to set these in Minecraft itself) and then save them. After that, you can load between these saved loadouts with a single click. It saves your current resource pack too.

In more technical terms, this program copies your current options.txt file -the one where every single setting is stored- and copies them to another file. When you load them, it copies that saved file to options.txt

# Where are my loadouts stored?
in .minecraft/mco_loadouts

# I examined the code, it's so unprofessional it makes my eyes bleed!
Sorry, I guess?

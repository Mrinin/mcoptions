# mcoptions
MCO is a python script that changes between options files and mods folders in a single click.

# Why would I use this?
Changing between Minecraft versions automatically resets most options, this script aims to automate changing your settings back. If you frequently change between versions (1.16-1.8-1.7 for example) this script will save you a lot of time, it also helps if you prefer different settings for different modes (e.g between creative and survival)

The same goes for mods folder. If you have different mods for different versions, this automates it too.

# How do I use this?
Simply run the executable, there you can save your currently set options (In Minecraft, so you have to set these in Minecraft itself) and mods folder then save them. After that, you can load between these saved loadouts with a single click. It saves your current resource pack too.

If a loadout loads options, it has a âš™ emoji next to it.
If a loadout loads optifine options, it has a ðŸ”§ emoji next to it.
If a loadout loads mods, it has a ðŸ”¨ emoji next to it.
If they save both, they will simply have both.

In more technical terms, this program copies your current options.txt file -the one where every single setting is stored-, your mods folder -the one that stores all the mods- and copies them to another file. When you load them, it copies that saved file to origina file.

# Where are my loadouts stored?
in .minecraft/mco_loadouts/name

# I examined the code, it's so unprofessional it makes my eyes bleed!
Sorry, I guess?
